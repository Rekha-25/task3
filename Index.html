        <h2 style="color:orangered;">About Cars</h2>
        <p class="matter">A car is a complex machine that comprises several mechanical and electrical components. However, understanding the basic parts of an automobile is not rocket science. You can go through the car parts list below to improve your car knowledge.
			The history of cars is more complicated than you would think, and the timeline stretches back to the late 1600s when a Dutch physicist designed the very first internal combustion engine. It wasn't until almost 100 years later that the very first self-powered road vehicles debuted powered by steam engines. Nicolas Joseph Cugnot of France built what is said to be the first automobile in 1769. While his invention is recognized by the British Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile Club de France as being the first, many history books say that the automobile was invented by either Gottlieb Daimler or Karl Benz. This is because both Daimler and Benz invented highly successful and practical gasoline-powered vehicles that ushered in the age of modern automobiles. They invented cars that looked and worked like the cars we use today.</p>

                <p class="available">The automobile was first invented and perfected in Germany and France in the late 1800s, though Americans quickly came to dominate the automotive 			industry in the first half of the twentieth century. Henry Ford innovated mass-production techniques that became standard, and Ford, General Motors and Chrysler emerged as 		the “Big Three” auto companies by the 1920s. Manufacturers funneled their resources to the military during World War II, and afterward automobile production in Europe and 		Japan soared to meet growing demand. Once vital to the expansion of American urban centers, the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as the 		leading automaker by 1980.</p>
